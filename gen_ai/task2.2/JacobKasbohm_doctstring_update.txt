Code Breakdown
1. UI Structure
    The component uses Material UI components to style the login form:
        -Container: Wraps the form to maintain a consistent width.
        -Box: A flex container that aligns the elements in the center with some padding and shadow.
        -Typography: Displays the "Login" heading and additional text.
        -TextField: Input fields for username and password.
        -Button: A submission button for login.
        -GoogleLogin: A button for Google OAuth authentication.
        -Alert: Displays messages for login status.
2. Form Submission Handling
    The form submission is handled by the handleSubmit function, which:
        -Prevents the default form submission.
        -Processes login credentials.
3. Google OAuth Handling
    The <GoogleLogin /> component initiates OAuth authentication.
        -On successful authentication, the handleGoogleLogin function processes the response.
        -If an error occurs, an error message is displayed.

Cod Usage
1. Import the login component into your main application file:
    import Login from "./Login"
