Function Documentation: std(data)
Purpose:

Calculates the standard deviation of a given dataset.
Parameters:

data (list of numbers): The dataset for which the standard deviation is calculated.
Returns:

float: The standard deviation of the dataset.
Process:

Calculate Mean:

Finds the mean of the input data using mean(data).
Sum of Squared Differences:

Iterates through each element.
Calculates the square of the difference between the element and the mean.
Accumulates the sum of these squared differences.
Variance and Deviation:

Divides the summation by the total number of elements (population variance).
Takes the square root of the variance using np.sqrt() to get the standard deviation.
Dependencies:

Requires numpy (np) and mean function to be imported.
Example Usage:

python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np
from statistics import mean

data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(std(data))  # Output: Standard deviation of the dataset
Notes:

This calculates the population standard deviation, not the sample standard deviation.
Ensure numpy and mean are properly imported before usage.
