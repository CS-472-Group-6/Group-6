There were several git commands I fonud useful during this lab
git log --pretty=format:"%h %an %ad" --date=short --name-only
This let me find all authors who touched a file

git fetch upstream
this was very useful to check if i needed to synch my edits with anything else that was added to the repo.

git checkout
I used this a few times to create and checkout a new branch.

The URL to my fork repo: https://github.com/EvanShumaker/Group-6
